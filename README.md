# drum-machine-js
drum machine built in vanilla js

Phase 1. A rebuilt JS30 (a-la Wes Bos) drum machine using grid and updated styling. 

Phase 2. Rewrite in React.

Phase 3. Add record and rewrite functionality to drum pads.

Phase 4. API integration to sample library for additional sound creation and loops.

Phase 5. Add expandable USB synth keyboard integration for ease of use and playability.

Phase 6. Ability to record performances and export MP3 files.


Goal - Fun and experimentation before I rebuild a Mellotron.
